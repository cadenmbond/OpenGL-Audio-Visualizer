## Overview

OpenGL Audio Visualizer, a real-time audio visualization tool built using C++, OpenGL, SFML and ImGui. It analyzes audio amplitude data and generates colorful visual squares that react dynamically to sound input.

This project was designed as a way for me to get to learn more about C++ libraries and audio sampling.

## NOTE
- Works best with 44100hz quality audio

## Features

- Dynamic square creation with color coding based on amplitude intensity
- Uses OpenGL for high-performance rendering
- Configurable amplitude thresholds
- Allows WAV audio file uploading
