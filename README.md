## Overview

OpenGL Audio Visualizer is a real-time audio visualization tool built using C++, OpenGL, and SFML. It analyzes audio amplitude data and generates colorful visual effects (like squares) that react dynamically to sound input.

This project is designed as a learning and experimentation platform for graphics programming, audio processing, and interactive visualization.

## Features

- Real-time audio amplitude sampling using SFML
- Dynamic square creation with color coding based on amplitude intensity
- Uses OpenGL for high-performance rendering
- Configurable amplitude thresholds and visual parameters
- Cross-platform compatibility (tested on Windows with Visual Studio 2022)
